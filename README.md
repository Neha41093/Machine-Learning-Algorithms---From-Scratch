# Machine-Learning-Algorithms---From-Scratch
PCA, K-Means (Normal, K-means++ and Elkan's accelerated) and EM algorithms implemented using different datasets from the UCI Repository.
Gk codes: Comparison between K-Means and EM algorithms
K_Means_Covtype and Elkans_Covtype: K-Means(Lloyd's Algorithm) and Elkan's accelerated K-Means on the covtype dataset
pca4: K-Means and EM on reduced data using PCA
extra: K-Means++ and EM++ (based on K-Means++ initialization methodology)
K_Means_Distances: K-Means using different distance functions
KMeans_3_datasets: K-Means on three different UCI Repository datasets
